Acoustic Scattering Models
Scatmod is a platform to distribute and develop acoustic scattering models, with the aim of simulating acoustic targets (e.g. fish, zooplankton, phytoplankton, crustaceans, jellyfish, bubbles, etc.). 
Scatmod aims to be a cross-language platform, containing models written in various languages, including Matlab, Python and R. 
In order to keep Scatmod consistent, documentation standards have been defined for all used languages.

## Available models and when to use/not to use them:



## TO DO:
- Write documentation standard for R, Python and Matlab
- Define validation standards for new models, e.g. Jupyter/Markdown templates for comparison to analystical model
Models to be included:

### Analytical
- Sphere and finite cylinde:
  - Solid / rigid
  - Pressure release
  - Elastic
  - Shelled
  
## Examples

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system
